## What is it
A small java game that lets users buy and sell fruit. The more fruit the buy the more fruit you will sell. As you make money
you earn colored block (that are shown in a grid). Each different block as a different "value" and you can buy boosts and upgrades
with this blocks. The blocks aut update once the grid is full. All the current numbers are inflated for testing purposes. 

The game can be saved and loaded, but only one game at a time. 
This was not a school project, just a fun summer project that I made myself. The description of the game is a high-level overview and all the intricacies of the game can be further explained if needed.

## How to run it 
Run the Java_Block_Game.jar file, provided you have classpaths and the current version of java. Because of some window formatting differences the game doesn't run well on linux, and is untesed on Mac. Made to run on windows.
